== Overview

AttainIT Technologies basic setup for a new Ubuntu OSINT Virtual Machine.

== Virtual Machine Setup

A virtual machine can be created on any viable hypervisor; we have documented 
a solution that uses Microsoft Hyper-V at the following locations:
* https://blog.attainittech.com/2022/03/installing-ubuntu-on-hyper-v/
* https://github.com/AttainIT-Technologies/vm-ubuntu-osint/wiki

Note that using a virtual machine is not required.  This repo will work the same
on any 20.04 LTS installation.  That being said, these workstations are meant to be
disposable so are built in a way as to be easily recreated.

== Installation

After your vm is built, issue the following commands to clone the repo, upgrade the
operating system, and finally apply the setup.

```
$ cd ~
$ sudo apt install git -y
$ git clone https://github.com/AttainIT-Technologies/vm-ubuntu-osint.git bin
$ cd bin
$ ./ubuntu-upgrade
$ ./bootstrap
```
